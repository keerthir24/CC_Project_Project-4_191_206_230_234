In contrast to a monolithic application, which is a singular and cohesive entity, a microservices architecture decomposes it into several independent, smaller units. To illustrate this concept, we have disassembled a calculator's monolithic architecture into various microservices, such as addition, subtraction, and division. These microservices interact with each other using RESTful APIs.

# Breaking down monoliths:
The objective of the project :

Convert a monolith architecture based docker-compose application into a microservices based architecture.

# Run:
run without the -d flag incase you want to observe the logs:

docker-compose up -d

To stop the services in detached mode:

docker-compose down
